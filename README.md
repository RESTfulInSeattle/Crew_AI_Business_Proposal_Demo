crewAI System 2 Thinking Demo with 3 AI agents developing a business proposal

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman proposes in his book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow", that thinking and decision making can be grouped into 2 main styles, or systems.

System 1 is fast, instinctual, and emotional
System 2 is slower, methodical, deliberate, and logical

In terms of AI, most models are essentially based on pattern recognition, and therefore would fall into System 1, but YouTuber and Coder Maya Akim hypothesized that crewAI's framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents could be used to more closely simulate a System 2 approach.

In her experiment she simulates creating a business plan based on an idea, from the debating of 3 AI agents, a Market Research Analyst, Technology Expert, and Business Development Consultant.

I've used her experiment and modified it to create a basic business plan on noise cancelling ear buds for electronic music producers, that will adapt the sound to the wearer's Audiogram, so that the music producer will hear the sound more accurately when listening to music through them.

I'll be using GPT-4, and refactoring based on results.
